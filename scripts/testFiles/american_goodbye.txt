Farewell, my $100.50 friend. 1.56 Please, let me go.
With the 12,333 heart, you're beating in my chest.
We are parting now, and we know -
It's for 11/23/2009 good. One day we'll find it best.

Farewell, my 0.5556 friend - no shaking hands, no crying.
Do not sadden your $50 eyebrows too much.
There's nothing new 12 about dying
In this life. Let alone this life as such.
